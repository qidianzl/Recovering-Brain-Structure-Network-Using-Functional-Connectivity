# Recovering-Brain-Structure-Network-Using-Functional-Connectivity
CODE
This is the source code of the following two papers:
[1] Zhang, Lu, Li Wang, and Dajiang Zhu. "Recovering brain structural connectivity from functional connectivity via multi-gcn based generative adversarial network." International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention. Springer, Cham, 2020.
[2] Zhang, Lu, Li Wang, and Dajiang Zhu. "Predicting Brain Structure Network using Functional Connectivity."  in process.

paper [1] proposed the Multi-GCN GAN model and structure preserving loss, paper [2] further expand the research on different datasets, different functional connectivity generation methods and different models.

DATA
We used 1064 subjects from HCP dataset and 132 subjects from ADNI dataset in our research. For each subject we generated the structural connectivity (SC) and the functional connectivity (FC). All of the connectivity matrices can be shared for research purpose. Please contack the author to obtain the data by sending email to lu.zhang2@mavs.uta.edu.
